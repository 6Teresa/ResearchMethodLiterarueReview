  abstract={This paper reports the results of a recent survey of user-centered design (UCD) practitioners. The survey involved over a hundred respondents who were CHI'2000 attendees or current UPA members. The paper identifies the most widely used methods and processes, the key factors that predict success, and the critical tradeoffs practitioners must make in applying UCD methods and processes. Results show that cost-benefit tradeoffs are a key consideration in the adoption of UCD methods. Measures of UCD effectiveness are lacking and rarely applied. There is also a major discrepancy between the commonly cited measures and the actually applied ones. These results have implications for the introduction, deployment, and execution of UCD projects}

abstract="We present a framework that incorporates user-centered design (UCD) philosophy into agile software development through a three-fold integration approach: at the process life-cycle level for the selection and application of appropriate UCD methods and techniques in the right places at the right times; at the iteration level for integrating UCD concepts, roles, and activities during each agile development iteration planning; and at the development-environment level for managing and automating the sets of UCD activities through automated tools support. We also present two automated tools---UEMan and TaMUlator, which provide the realization of the development-environment level integration.",

  abstract={The  use  of  information  and  communication  technology  could  increase the quantity and quality of agricultural production, including horticul-ture.  This  study  focuses  on  the  development  of  a  mobile-based  interface  that  makes  it  easier  for  farmers  to  view  the  data  obtained  from  the  results  of  land  monitoring.  In  designing  mobile  devices,  applications,  and  user  interfaces,  it  is  important  to  consider  the  user  experience.  This  paper  focuses  on  UX  design  which  is  based  on  User-Centered  Design  approach  that  focuses  on  user  needs  and prioritizes empathy for users, so as to accommodate the identification of user needs and produce high fidelity prototype. Based on the System Usability Scale and the User Experience Questionnaire testing on the prototype, it was found that the level of acceptance of horticultural farmers was positive with the level of the value of all UX elements above the average. }

  abstract={Designing an effective user interface (UI) of e-Learning system that has excellent usability is a crucial activity in e-Learning development. Nowadays, user-centered design (UCD) is a popular method used for developing the user interfaces of e-Learning systems and modules. This systematic literature review offers a helicopter view of the state-of-the-art applications of UCD for designing the UI of e-Learning systems. This study reviewed 17 works of literature from 2015 until early 2020 to identify how research in the development of e-Learning system applied UCD and its impacts on the usability of the developed systems. This study found that many e-Learning system development projects applied UCD differently in terms of methods and user involvement. The most popular methods integrated with the UCD are questionnaires, interviews, high-fidelity prototyping, and usability testing. The study also found that some of the projects that used UCD with involving the users in multiple phases produced a design with good usability. Furthermore, this study suggests that both learners and subject matter experts should be involved in the design process of e-Learning system to acquire both excellent UI and effective learning process.},

  year={2014},
  volume={},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={The development of a web platform is a complex and interdisciplinary task, where people with different roles such as project manager, designer or developer participate. Different usability and User Experience evaluation methods can be used in each stage of the development life cycle, but not all of them have the same influence in the software development and in the final product or system. This article presents the study of the impact of these methods applied in the context of an e-Learning platform development. The results show that the impact has been strong from a developer's perspective. Developer team members considered that usability and User Experience evaluation allowed them mainly to identify design mistakes, improve the platform's usability and understand the end users and their needs in a better way. Interviews with potential users, clickmaps and scrollmaps were rated as the most useful methods. Finally, these methods were considered unanimously very useful in the context of the entire software development, only comparable to SCRUM meetings and overcoming the rest of involved factors.},

  abstract={User experience (UX) is a branch of human computer interaction (HCI) field. UX is a study that focuses on behaviours, attitudes, and perspectives towards services or technologies used within a specific context such as teaching and learning context. The teaching and learning process has evolved from traditional to e-learning and recently interactive e-learning settings. The aim of this research is to study UX in online interactive  e-learning.  The  study  use  observation,  interview,  and  survey  methods  for  data  collection. Quantitative and qualitative analyses methods were applied. Findings of the study suggest that students and a teacher demonstrate positive attitudes and behaviours towards online interactive e-learning. Moreover, most of the advantages of face-to-face class interaction in a traditional classroom can be also achieved in online interactive e-learning. The interactive e-learning setting helps less confident and shy students to participate resulting in engagement between a teacher and students.  Despite the power of new technologies in stimulating students to learn and retain knowledge in a more effective way, there is still room to improve the technologies to give a better UX to the teacher.  }

  abstract={E-learning platforms have become more and more complex. Their functionality includedin  learning  management  systems  is  extended  with  collaborative  platforms,  which  allow  bettercommunication, group collaboration, and face-to-face lectures. Universities are facing the challenge ofadvanced use of these platforms to fulfil sustainable learning goals. Better usability and attractivenessbecame essential in successful e-learning platforms, especially due to the more intensive interactivityexpected from students. In the study, we researched the user experience of students who have usedMoodle, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet.  User experience is, in most cases, connected with aperson’s perception, person’s feelings, and satisfaction with the platform used. Data were collectedusing a standard UEQ questionnaire.  With this research, we examined whether user experiencefactors: perceived efficiency, perceived perspicuity, perceived dependability, perceived stimulation,and perceived novelty affect perceived attractiveness, which is an important factor in the sustainabilityof e-learning tools. The collected data were processed using SmartPLS. The research study showedthat all studied factors have a statistically significant impact on perceived attractiveness.  Factorperceived stimulation has the strongest statistically significant impact on the perceived attractivenessof e-learning platforms, followed by perceived efficiency, perceived perspicuity, perceived novelty,and perceived dependability.}

abstract = {e-Learning tools have profoundly transformed modern pedagogical approaches. Vendors provide different types of systems, such as self-paced (SP) and instructor–student interactive (ISI) e-Learning tools. Although both types of tools represent promising solutions to facilitate the learning process, it is important to theoretically identify a framework to evaluate the success of these tools and assess whether one type of tool is more effective than another. Toward this end, we (1) propose a model to evaluate e-Learning tools’ success by extending and contextualizing Seddon’s information systems (IS) success model for the e-Learning environment and (2) formulate four hypotheses to predict the differences in the success factors between SP and ISI tools. We test the model and hypotheses using data from 783 students across seven higher education institutions in Hong Kong. The results support the proposed e-Learning tool success model and three of the four hypotheses. ISI tools outperform SP tools in terms of system quality, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and learning outcome.}

To  serve  different  learning  styles  in  a  class  with  a number  of  students  using  the  conventionalface-to-face  teaching  method  is  not practical;therefore,the idea of personalized e-Learning to accommodate differ-ences inlearning style has arisen. Building onthis idea, this research intends to provide an alternative interaction design for e-Learning modules by developing content based on user needsusingthe User-Centered Design methodology. Due to a lack of e-Learning content for visual and global preferencesin the Felder-Silverman  learning  styles, User-CenteredDesign is  chosen  as  the  basis  to  de-sign  the  e-Learning  module.  The  result consists  of an alternative  design  and a proposed interface design.The alternative design describes learning objects and navigation of the e-Learning module. The proposed interface design is aproto-type of  an  interactive  e-Learning  module.  After  being  evaluated, the  prototype satisfies the user's  expectations in  terms of content  translation,  content  naviga-tion, and interactivity throughout the module.}
